## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a personal blog website for a client who is passionate about writing and sharing thoughtful, in-depth blogs on a wide range of topics including science, physics, technology, and social issues. While the client has previously shared content on platforms like LinkedIn, they have expressed a strong desire for a more personalized, focused, and appreciative space where their ideas can be freely shared and properly valued by a wider audience.

The proposed website will serve as a personal platform, allowing the client to publish, manage, and categorize blog posts, while maintaining complete creative and administrative control.

## 7. Client’s Vision

The client’s core motivation for this project stems from a desire to maintain the integrity and impact of their content. They have experienced that audiences on general-purpose platforms such as LinkedIn may not always be the right fit for the depth and nuance of their writing. Hence, they wish to create a more focused, personal platform where their voice and ideas can be appreciated in the right context.

This website is not only a content-sharing tool but also a reflection of the client’s commitment to authentic, unfiltered expression across scientific and social domains.
